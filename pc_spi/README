This program is a simple not definitive test software
that has been written to test the behavior of the software
in the project directory. It sends and receives spi data
using a parallel port. 

The program has some problems (I apologize!!!):

- syncronization, then sometimes sends wrong data!
- buffers, the dimension are not checked!

This code runs only in super-user mode.

To compile it run make all at the prompt:

#make all <enter>

pc_spi m stringcmd	sends a command to a slave receiver acting as master.

Loop modes:

pc_spi S 		starts the program as slave 
pc_spi			starts as master

This two command doesn't exits. They remain in loop acting as slave
or master as set at start time.

To exit from the loop type q

To insert a string to send type s

This software supports other line command. See the main function.

This software (in loop mode) supports other keyboard command. See
the keyboardCommand function.


Master connection:
Parallel port

STROBE			Pin 1 (not used - In my environment is used to
				drive a 74LS245)
--------------------------------------------
DO	(PC send)	Pin 2
SCK	(PC master clk)	Pin 3
CS	(PC master cs)	Pin 4
DI	(PC receive)	Pin 10
--------------------------------------------
SCK 	(PC slave clk)	Pin 12
CS	(PC slave cs)	Pin 13
--------------------------------------------

Then:

If you use the PC as slave you have:

SCK	Pin 12
CS	Pin 13
MISO	Pin 2
MOSI	PIN 10

If you use the PC as master you have:

SCK	Pin 3
CS	Pin 4
MISO	Pin 10
MOSI 	Pin 2
